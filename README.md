# OpenCV Facial Recognition Project (Beginner Level)

This repository contains a small project that focuses on facial recognition in images using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. This project is designed for beginners, making it an ideal starting point for those new to OpenCV.

### Introduction:

The project utilizes OpenCV's face detection capabilities, specifically the Haar cascades technique, which is a machine learning approach. In this project, we will treat OpenCV as a black box, leveraging its pre-trained models for detecting faces, eyes, and smiles.

While OpenCV provides the flexibility to train custom models for detecting various objects, such as hot dogs or flutes, our primary objective in this project is to use the existing classifiers and explore their capabilities in detecting interesting portions of an image.

### Contributions and Feedback:

Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are highly encouraged. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
